<p>How and why is science used to manipulate people in public discourse? In this unit, we will focus on the political sphere to examine how “scientifically proven” ideas are used (or abused) to change opinions and even policy. We will look at cases where scientific consensus has been brought into question in the political sphere, and at moments when politicians have called on the scientific community to support untestable claims. We will also examine anti-intellectual sentiment and how it attempts to counter the rhetorical power of science.</p>

<p>In Unit 2, you will be asked to select a researcher at the University of Texas whose work is related to the subject of your previous paper. You will then prepare for and conduct an interview with the researcher of your choice. You will finish by producing a researcher profile and publishable interview.</p>

<p>You will complete this unit with an understanding of – and ability to critically evaluate - the rhetoric of science in popular discourse. You will also develop basic skills for conducting, recording, processing and reporting interviews.</p>
