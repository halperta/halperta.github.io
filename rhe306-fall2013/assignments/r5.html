<h2 id='assignment_overview'>Assignment Overview</h2>

<p>Write a one-page (8.5x11) paper explaining how you found a specific print source using the UT library resources covered in class (something that you found, for instance, using LexisNexis but that initially appeared in a magazine, newspaper, or other print venue). Evaluate that source&#8217;s credibility, and summarize its argument.</p>

<p>Put your name in the top left hand corner and list the author&#8217;s name and the full citation information of the piece you&#8217;re summarizing; set margins at 1 inch, spacing at single, and font at 12 pt. Do not exceed a page in length. This should be about 500 words.</p>

<p>Finding a Source: Using a UT library database, locate a print source that will help you to analyze your primary text. You may find an article that you can compare to the text you&#8217;re analyzing. (For example, if you&#8217;re analyzing a video with a moving set of images, perhaps you can find a magazine article that presents similar images to the same audience in an effort at making them feel the same thing.) Or you may look for an article that contrasts with the text you&#8217;re analyzing. (For example, if a video tries to persuade one audience of political liberals with certain images, can you find a print source that tries to persuade political moderates or conservatives with different images or different appeals?) You may find a print source that teaches you something about the audience. (Can you find an article that describes the audience for this blog?) Finally, you may find a print source that teaches you something about the venue. (Did other articles published in this magazine have a similarly conservative political bent?)</p>

<h2 id='specifics'>Specifics</h2>

<p>This research summary must include four sections:</p>

<p>In the first section of your summary, identify your controversy and briefly describe the text you’ll be analyzing in Essay II. Explain how the text you’re summarizing relates to the text you&#8217;re analyzing in Essay II. Does this source teach you something about the audience, the venue, or the conversation? How can you use this source to inform your analysis in Essay II?</p>

<p>In the second section of your summary, explain what library database you used to find this source. Which, if any, database(s) did you use? Did you try any other databases, and why did you settle on this one? Also, explain how you used the database. What keywords were most effective? If your initial search produced too many results, what strategies did you use to refine your results?</p>

<p>In the third section of your summary, explain whether or not and why you believe that this is a credible source. Consider three possible factors: the author, the publisher, and the text. Is the author an authority in this area? Does the author write in a credible way (without inflammatory language, providing lots of sources to show research, referencing recent and relevant information)? Is the publisher (magazine or newspaper) respected by a certain community? Does the publication (magazine or newspaper) appear respectable/believable and why? Does the text include elements that indicate careful research, such as: the citation of credible sources; the careful presentation of evidence; explanation of where a reader can learn more about this evidence? Does the text argue in an apparently responsible manner?</p>

<p>In the fourth section of your summary, offer a concise but thorough summary of the position this source is advocating. Stay as close to the text as possible, quoting the author&#8217;s exact words at times to tie both you and your readers to the original text itself—cite page numbers for any quotations in parentheses after the quote (just the page numbers; no pp. or p.). Your aim is to hand over to your readers your understanding of WHAT this text is arguing for. Phrases such as &#8220;Smith says/notes/states,&#8221; or &#8220;according to Bell,&#8221; etc. will help you designate what is called intellectual property. You will not have room to cover all the points an author makes, so you will need to synthesize the information for us; tell us what position the author is advocating, and then offer quotes from the text itself to demonstrate (to show us) that the author is arguing what you say s/he&#8217;s arguing. Do not offer your own comments, opinions, or arguments about what the text says, and do not offer a rhetorical analysis of the writing. Stick to content: What is the author saying in this text? What position is s/he advocating?</p>
