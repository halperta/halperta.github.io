In 2024, I led the development of NEH's State and Impact of the Humanities grant program, in partnership with colleagues in the Office of Data and Evaluation and across NEH. As part of that process, we conducted a multi-phased assessment of the needs of the field. That work resulted in both an internal report and a public report. The public report can be viewed here.

While the program launched in January of 2025, it was cancelled before awards were made.
