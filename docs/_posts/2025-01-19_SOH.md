In 2024, I led the development of NEH's State and Impact of the Humanities grant program, in partnership with colleagues across NEH. 

The SAITH program launched in January of 2025. While the program was cancelled before awards were made, the Notice of Funding Opportunity offers a window into one vision for the study of the humanities a profession and an area of study.
