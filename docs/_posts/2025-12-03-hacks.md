Interview with Brooke Mai and Hannah Alpert-Abrams for *Job Hacks for Humanists*. Excerpt:

*I’m excited to post this interview with Hannah Alpert-Abrams, an expert in alt-ac careers (yes, she likes the term!) and in communicating the value of the humanities. After serving as a Program Officer with the National Endowment for the Humanities for almost 6 years, she has now embarked on a journey co-founding Sidra Collaborative, a consultancy helping arts, culture, and humanities organizations receive critical funding. She is also the author of “Finding Your Purpose,” a workbook to help people “navigate the contradictions between the work we are driven to do and the conditions we face in our working lives.”*

*I really enjoyed this conversation about the importance of the humanities and the value of labor, and I think it will be valuable to people even outside of the academic/alt-ac world looking to build a career that matches their personal mission statement and values.*
