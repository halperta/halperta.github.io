# Hire Me
In March of 2025, I left my position as a Senior Program Officer at the National Endowment for the Humanities. A week later, DOGE agents entered the NEH offices. Two months later, my office no longer existed, and more than 70% of staff had been laid off.

As I determine my next professional steps, I am available for public speaking, consultations, guest lectures, and workshops on the following topics:
* [Finding Your Purpose](/shalperta%20press/purpose/): navigating justice-oriented careers in times of crisis
* [Taking Action in Higher Education](/shalperta%20press/risk/): understanding our role in institutional change
* Community-centered digital humanities

My rates are sliding scale as follows:
* Guest lectures: $75-$125
* Public speaking and workshops: $250-$1500, depending on details
* Consultations: $60-$75/hour after the first (free) meeting
* Informational Interviews: free! Read below.

I also have limited availability to teach multi-week or semester-length online courses on digital humanities or funding, typically within humanities or information studies programs. 

Do you have paid opportunities that may be of interest to former federal workers? Even if the position isn't a good fit for me, I have a strong network and am happy to pass information along. 


# Informational Interviews

Are you a student or contingent worker interested in speaking with me about my career trajectory or current work? I am happy to schedule a 45 minute conversation about digital humanities careers, leaving academia, and working at a funding agency.

Email me to schedule a conversation. Some things you might include in your email: a little bit about yourself (where you work/study, what you're interested in, etc.) and what it is about my work that particularly interests you.


If you're not sure how to conduct an informational interview, check out this great resource from the Job Market Support Network: [Informational Interviewing for PhDs by Dr. Susan Martin, University of Maryland](https://hcommons.org/docs/informational-interviewing-for-phds/).

Once we've spoken, I consider you part of my professional network, and would be happy to hear updates on your career search or to answer any additional questions that come to mind, to the best of my ability. Please note that an informational interview does not mean I'll be able to help you get a job at my agency, or anywhere else for that matter. I also can't promise that I will immediately recognize you if we meet again --- I am truly awful at names and faces. Please don't take it personally!

# Students and Interns

Have you worked with me as a student or intern? If I have taught a class you were in or supervised you as an intern, I consider it part of my job to do the following: 
* Have regular conversations about your studies and career
* Provide feedback on your job materials
* Write letters of recommendation.

If you want a letter of recommendation or for me to serve as a reference, please provide the following: a copy of your resume/cv and cover letter, a copy of the job description, and a brief description of anything you would particularly like me to cover when speaking with the search committee. If you were my student, please note that I may not be the best person to write a letter: status matters, and faculty on the tenure track matter more. If you were my intern at the NEH, I am happy to speak in my capacity as an NEH staff member, which carries a little more weight. For letters, please give me at least two weeks notice.

If you are a student who I have worked with in any capacity and just want to talk about career stuff, don't be afraid to reach out! I am always glad to think through career possibilities with you, and if I know what you're looking for, I'll be better able to connect you with colleagues or pass on things that may be of interest. Send me an email with a brief description of what's going on in your professional life and we can find a time to talk.

<!-- # Public speaking

I am occasionally able to speak publicly about my career trajectory on panels or at campuses. If you are a university employee who would like me to speak on your campus, please provide information about how my presentation will be part of a more comprehensive initiative to improve career experiences for grad students, and how you will be compensating speakers. Please also note that I am a white cis woman and I prefer not to take part in all-white panels or speaker series. [Here's an article about how to invite an alt-ac speaker to campus.](https://halperta.medium.com/so-you-want-to-invite-an-alt-ac-to-speak-on-your-campus-a46da71366d0)

If you are a graduate student creating your own bottom-up career initiative in the absence of institutional support, don't hesitate to reach out! If I'm not able to participate, I'd be glad to share resources and help connect you with others who might be. As above, please make sure to include some info about what kinds of support your institution is providing... or not.  -->
