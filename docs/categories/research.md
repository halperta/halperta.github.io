<p style="text-align: center;">As a researcher, I studied how cultural heritage institutions have used text technologies like lithography, photostats, and optical character recognition to shape how we read history. I was particularly interested in how these technologies are used to replicate and intervene in the violence caused by national, colonial, and imperial relationships. In my digital humanities work, I sought to put these theoretical questions into practice.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">My last scholarly appointmented ended in 2019. I have not conducted original scholarly work since that time.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">From 2023-2025, I helped to establish the Office of Data and Evaluation at the National Endowment for the Humanities. During that time, I conducted research on the state of the field and developed a new grant program to support research in this area (although it was cancelled under guidance from DOGE). You can find the public-facing elements of that work here.</p>
