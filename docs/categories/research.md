<p style="text-align: center;">I have supported academic scholarship both through my own research and at the National Endowment for the Humanities.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">My own research focused on how cultural heritage institutions have used text technologies like lithography, photostats, and optical character recognition to shape how we read history. Through Digital Humanities projects and scholarly writing, I explored how these technologies replicate and intervene in state and cultural violence. I have not conducted original scholarly research since my last academic appointmented ended in 2019.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">From 2023-2025, I helped to establish the Office of Data and Evaluation at the National Endowment for the Humanities. During that time, I conducted research on the state of the field and developed a new grant program to support research in this area (although it was cancelled under guidance from DOGE). You can find some examples of the public-facing elements of that work here.</p>
