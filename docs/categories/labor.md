<p style="text-align: center;">I write, speak, and develop projects related to building a better future for justiced-oriented workers in the knowledge and culture industries. That includes people working in education and academia, as well as those based in libraries, museums, and beyond. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I believe that education and cultural work are fundamental to our collective good. I believe that we deserve institutions that uplift and support that work and the people who do it. We are not there yet.</p>
