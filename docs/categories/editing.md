# Let's get that book written

Since 2009, I have been partnering with non-fiction and academic writers to transform big ideas into publishable manuscripts. 

I work with visionary non-fiction writers (like you!), including current and former academics and career professionals. I have worked with people in the humanities, social sciences, psychology, business, and journalism. I have worked on academic projects published with university presses as well as general-audience books published in the mainstream press. Ask me about the time I worked on a New York Times best seller.

You might want to work with me if you are:
* Attempting a book-length project for the first time and unsure how to begin
* Stuck in a writing rut or struggling with writer's block
* Struggling to balance your writing projects with your full time job
* Shifting your work from academic to popular non-fiction
* Turning your dissertation into a publishable monograph
* Looking for external support for your first post-tenure book project
* Co-authoring and looking for outside help managing different perspectives or styles.

# My services
I work with writers in two ways. 

As a developmental editor, I will read and provide feedback on a chapter or full manuscript. I will provide high-level feedback on structure, content, and form. I do not provide sentence-level copyediting. 

As a writing coach, I can help you get your project to completion. Sometimes I work with people at the very start of their book projects who are trying to figure out how to shape their big idea. Other times, I work with people partway through a project who are feeling stuck and overwhelmed. Or I might work with someone who has finished a draft of their manuscript and isn't sure where to go next. I also provide accountability coaching for people who are struggling to meet deadlines and get things done. 

I primarily work with non-fiction writers who are developing book-length manuscripts for academic or popular presses. I can also provide support on writing book proposals and responding to reader feedback.

# Packages
## Individual Coaching
I offer one-off coaching sessions to discuss a writing challenge, strategize to overcome limitations, or make a plan to accomplish a task. Individual sessions are $90/hour.

## Project Jump-Start
This short-term package is for people who are trying to get a project started or to revisit a project after an extended break. Over 4-8 weeks, we will identify goals and challenges, develop a strategy and timeline for success, and discuss any writing challenges that are standing in your way. By the end of the sequence, you should be positioned to move your project forward with confidence. 

This package costs $400 and includes four hour-long semi-structured sessions, intermediate assignments, and a month of free accountability check-ins following our final session. I will read and provide generalized feedback on your draft at an additional negotiated rate. 

## Getting Unstuck
This short-term package is for people struggling with writer's block. We begin with a one-hour meeting to name and understand the barriers that are holding you back. Through a three-hour intensive retreat (or three one-hour sessions), we will work through a series of exercises to get you unstuck. In a final one-hour session, we will reflect on outcomes from the retreat and make a plan for you to move forward with your work.

This package costs $500 and includes five hours of conversation (3-5 sessions), intermediate assignments, and a month of free accountability check-ins following our final session. I will read and provide generalized feedback on your draft at an additional negotiated rate. 

## Manuscript editing

### Book-Length Manuscripts
I will read your entire book manuscript and provide high-level feedback and recommendations for next steps. The cost will depend on the length and style of the manuscript. A 100,000-word monograph would take about thirty hours to read and review, at a cost of about $1,800 (including a meeting to discuss feedback). A 60,000-word book for a general audience would take about twenty hours to read and review, at a cost of about $1,200.

### Book Chapters

I will read a single chapter and provide more detailed feedback and recommendations for next steps. The cost will depend on the length and style of the manuscript. A 6,000-word monograph chapter would take about five hours to read and review and would cost $360 (including a meeting to discuss feedback.)

### Editorial Support
I can provide long-term editorial support as you write your book in the form of chapter and manuscript feedback. This would involve setting a timeline for completion, reading and providing detailed feedback on chapters as you complete them, and a final manuscript review. While packages will vary depending on the length of the project and style of writing, for a 100,000 word monograph the costs would be approximately:
* $300 for each chapter (including written feedback and a meeting)
* $1700 for the full manuscript review (including written feedback and a meeting)

# Why me
There are lots of people offering editorial services out there. Like picking a therapist, picking an editor or writing coach is about both expertise and fit. You want to find someone who is extremely good at understanding language and structure. But you also want someone whose values and approach to the work aligns with your own.

I am an expert writer and an experienced editor. My experience includes developmental editing for over a dozen scholarly and general non-fiction books; teaching college- and graduate-level writing in the classroom; and editing scholarly and public humanities blogs and journals. I have a PhD in comparative literature and am a writer myself.

My approach to writing is both personal and values-driven. I do this work because I need to make a living... but also because I believe in the power of the written word. I believe that you have a story to tell that matters. I want to make sure you get the chance to tell it. And I want to help you do that without suffering too much for the craft.

I am especially interested in projects that are centered on justice, social change, and working towards our collective good.
