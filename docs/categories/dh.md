<p style="text-align: center;"> Since the summer of 2013, when I attended the California Rare Books School and first learned about how people were using digital technologies to make rare books more accessible, I have been working in and around digital humanities: as a scholar, as an advocate, as an educator, and as a grantmaker. </p>

<p style="text-align: center;"> The projects presented here range from data visualizations related to labor advocacy to experimental research in natural language processing.</p>
