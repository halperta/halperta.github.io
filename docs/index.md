Hello. 

I am a justice-oriented worker dedicated to education, cultural heritage, and public knowledge. 

I write for academic and general audiences, provide consultant services, and collaborate on creative projects. [Learn more about working with me.](/categories/mentorship/)

I wrote a [workbook](/shalperta%20press/purpose/) about finding your professional purpose and collaborated on an [Academic Tarot deck](https://halperta.com/visionary%20futures%20collective/tarot/). 

# About Me

I have spent most of my career working in the humanities, which encompasses the study of art, history, language, and culture. I have written about labor in higher education, about the use of technology in accessing the past and reshaping the future, and about the importance of radical transparency, shared vulnerability, and collective action in higher education.

Since 2011, I have held positions in higher education, academic libraries, and the civil service. From 2019-2025, I worked at the National Endowment for the Humanities, where I helped redirect taxpayer dollars towards the public good through grants and fellowships related to digital humanities, open access publication, and understanding the state of the humanities. I previously worked at Brown University and the University of Texas at Austin, where I earned my PhD in 2017. [Learn more about my work here.](/categories/research/)

I have written and spoken extensively about labor and careers in the humanities. From 2021-2025, I was the acting unit vice president of NEH AFGE Local 3403, and in 2020, I co-founded the [Visionary Futures Collective](https://visionary-futures-collective.github.io/), a loosely organized group of humanities professionals dedicated to labor issues during the first years of the coronavirus pandemic.
