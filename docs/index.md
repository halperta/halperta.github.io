Hello. 

I am a justice-oriented worker dedicated to education, cultural heritage, and public knowledge. 

# hire me
In March of 2025, I left my position as a Senior Program Officer at the National Endowment for the Humanities. A week later, DOGE agent entered the NEH offices. Two months later, my office no longer existed, and more than 70% of staff had been laid off.

As I determine my next professional steps, I am available to teach asynchronous courses and give workshops and guest lectures in the following areas: 
* Finding your professional purpose in a time of crisis
* Federal funding and the future of humanities research
* Community-centered digital humanities

# about me

I have spent most of my career working in the humanities, which encompasses the study of art, history, language, and culture. I have written about labor in higher education, about the use of technology in accessing the past and reshaping the future, and about the importance of radical transparency, shared vulnerability, and collective action in higher education.


Since 2011, I have worked in higher education, academic libraries, and the civil service. From 2019-2025, I worked at the National Endowment for the Humanities, where I helped redirect taxpayer dollars towards the public good through grants and fellowships related to digital humanities, open access publication, and understanding the state of the humanities. 

Since 2016, I have written and spoken about labor and careers in the humanities and higher education. From 2021-2025, I was the acting unit vice president of NEH AFGE Local 3403. 

In 2020, I co-founded the [Visionary Futures Collective](https://visionary-futures-collective.github.io/), a loosely organized group of humanities professionals dedicated to labor issues during the first years of the coronavirus pandemic.
