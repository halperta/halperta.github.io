Hello. 

I am a justice-oriented scholar dedicated to supporting publicly-funded higher education, which I believe is fundamental to our collective good. I work in the humanities, which encompasses the study of art, history, language, and culture. I write about labor in higher education, about the use of technology in accessing the past and reshaping the future, and about the importance of radical transparency, shared vulnerability, and collective action in higher education.

From 2019-2025, I worked in the Offices of DIgital Humanities and Data and Evaluation at the National Endowment for the Humanities. From 2021-2025, I was NEH's acting unit vice president of AFGE Local 3403. The views on this website do not reflect those of the NEH or the federal government.

I am a founding member of the [Visionary Futures Collective](https://visionary-futures-collective.github.io/).
