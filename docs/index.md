Hello. 

I am a justice-oriented worker dedicated to education, cultural heritage, and public knowledge. 

I have spent most of my career working in the humanities, which encompasses the study of art, history, language, and culture. I have written about labor in higher education, about the use of technology in accessing the past and reshaping the future, and about the importance of radical transparency, shared vulnerability, and collective action in higher education.

For almost fifteen years, I have held positions in higher education, academic libraries, and the civil service. From 2019-2025, I worked at the National Endowment for the Humanities, where I helped redirect taxpayer dollars towards the public good through grants and fellowships related to digital humanities, open access publication, and understanding the state of the humanities.

I have written and spoken extensively about labor and careers in the humanities. From 2021-2025, I was the acting unit vice president of NEH AFGE Local 3403. 

In 2020, I co-founded the [Visionary Futures Collective](https://visionary-futures-collective.github.io/), a loosely organized group of humanities professionals dedicated to labor issues during the first years of the coronavirus pandemic.
